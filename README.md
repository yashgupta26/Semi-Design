# Semi-Design

This repositary contains Verilog codes done by me during my internship/training at Semi Design.  

Use any EDA/Simulation tool to run the codes or visit edaplayground.com.  

If you have iverilog installed locally, run the below commands <br>  
i.) To compile -> iverilog -o <codename_of_file> <designname.v> <testbenchname.v> <br>
ii.) To view the simulation result -> vvp <codename_of_file> <br>
iii.) To view waveform -> gtkwave <wavename.vcd> <br>
